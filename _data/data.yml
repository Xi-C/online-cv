    title: About Me
    summary: |
      I am a postdoctoral researcher in [the Jagust Lab](https://jagustlab.neuro.berkeley.edu) at [the University of 
      California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu) and [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov),
      with experience in experimental design, neuroimaging (PET, structural 
      and functional MRI), and advanced statistical analysis (linear/nonlinear 
      regression, causal inference approach, multivariate analysis, structural 
      equation modeling, linear mixed model). I completed my Ph.D. in Cognition 
      and Neuroscience with Dr. Denise Park at the University of Texas at Dallas.


      I am interested in age-related changes in cognition, brain structure, and 
      brain function. Specifically, using Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and 
      Positron Emission Tomography (PET), I study behavioral and brain 
      differences in healthy older individuals and those at the preclinical stage
      of Alzheimer's Disease (AD). My research also incorporates advanced 
      statistical techniques and explores individual differences separating 
      normal and successful agers. Ultimately, I am interested in understanding 
      brain and behavioral changes in pathological, normal, and successful aging.

experiences:
    - role: Postdoctoral Researcher
      time: 2020 Janurary - Present
      company: UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
      details: |
          - Worked with large longitudinal datasets of multi-modal neuroimaging 
          and cognitive data in normal older adults
          - Developed a new fMRI experiment to assess specific memory deficits 
          related to early AD pathology
          - Utilized FTP-PET and PiB-PET to examine the effect of normal aging 
          and early AD pathology on longitudinal memory changes in older adults
          - Demonstrated key regions of tau deposition that are most predictive 
          of future memory decline in older adults with and without AD pathology
    - role: Graduate Research Assistant
      time: 2014 June - 2019 December
      company: UT Dallas
      details: |
          - Worked with and helped develop cognitive measures for the Dallas 
          Lifespan Brain Study, a longitudinal investigation of behavioral and 
          brain changes across the adult lifespan.
          - Examined longitudinal cognitive change in multiple cognitive domains 
          using structural equation modeling. 
          - Performed neuroimaging analyses with PET, structural MRI, and 
          functional MRI data in a large-scale, across-lifespan sample.
          - Gained experience in working with cerebrovascular-reactivity and 
          cerebral blood flow data to examine neurovascular effects on cognition.
          - Demonstrated that subjective memory concerns in objectively normal 
          adults was a valid indicator of worse memory performance, greater 
          memory decline, and decreased brain function in the hippocampus.

    title: Projects
#    intro: >
#      My current work focuses on three main questions.
    assignments:
      - title: What are the functional activation features in successful agers?
#        link: "#"
        tagline: "Although older adults often present worse cognitive performance, some still manage to maintain cognitive functions. Explorations on the functional basis for this resistance to age-related decline may provide a hint of the key to successful aging."

      - title: How are memory systems affected by aging and Alzheimer's Disease?
#        link: "#hook"
        tagline: "Memory declines with increasing age and in AD, but how are episodic memory differently affected in normal and pathological aging? Are there specific behavioral markers that are sensitive to alert AD-related memory deficits? Understanding these questions will greatly help with the early detection of AD and the development of better screening tools in clinical trials for AD treatments."

      - title: How do socioeconomic status factors affect age-related declines?
#        link: "#"
        tagline: "Many important socioeconomic status factors (e.g., education, occupation) are shown to be related to differences in cognitive aging. But it is unclear what is the underlying mechanism, and to what extent it affects cognitive declines in normal and pathological aging."
